🚀 Excited to share my recent project where I deployed a Fake News Classification model using Logistic Regression with Streamlit! 📰🔍
In today's digital age, discerning between fake and genuine news is crucial. To contribute to this effort, I built a machine learning model that classifies news articles into fake or genuine categories using logistic regression, a powerful technique for binary classification tasks.
Here's a glimpse of what I achieved:
🔍 Data Collection: Gathered a labeled dataset of news articles from reputable sources, distinguishing between fake and genuine articles.
🛠️ Preprocessing: Prepared the text data for analysis by applying techniques like tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stop words to enhance the model's accuracy.
🔢 Feature Extraction: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform the text data into numerical features, crucial for logistic regression.
⚙️ Model Training: Trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn on the preprocessed data, enabling it to learn patterns and make predictions based on input features.
📊 Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in classifying news articles.
🚀 Deployment with Streamlit: Leveraged Streamlit, an intuitive Python library, to deploy the model as a web application, enabling users to interactively classify news articles on-the-fly.
With this project, I aim to contribute to the fight against misinformation and empower individuals to make informed decisions in today's fast-paced media landscape.
